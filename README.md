# WordSentiments
Analyze scripts of different Star Trek episodes using word sentiments

The second project in a data science course at the University of Mississippi with Dr. Jones

Given is two sets of Star Trek episode scripts, separated by filenames (either leading a or leading b), and two csv files that
make up the sentiment lexicon (I can't quite recall where this data comes from but I know it was from students at another 
school ranking words based on sentiment)

The python script lets the user pick which group of scripts to analyze (a or b) and then counts all the negative, weak negative,
neutral, weak positive, and positive words found in the group. Then the script makes a bar chart showing these counts.
